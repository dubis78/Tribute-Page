      <h3 id="text">Japan's godfather of animation</h3>
        <p id="miyazaki"> It would be no exaggeration to describe Hayao Miyazaki as the godfather of animation in Japan - some might even say the world. Since his directorial debut in 1979, his gentle and whimsical children's movies have been hugely popular and become key cultural icons. 
            Spirited Away is still Japan's highest grossing movie of all time while other works like My Neighbour Totoro are considered canon. He and his company Studio Ghibli, which he founded in 1985, have often been called Japan's answer to Walt Disney - but in many ways Miyazaki has proven to be a complete original.</br>
            <br>Miyazaki is regarded by many as the world's greatest living animator and an icon of Japanese popular culture.
            In 2002, his work burst onto international screens with the ghostly animation "Spirited Away." It smashed box office records in Japan and earned him an Oscar for Best Animated Feature.
            Setting up Studio Ghibli in 1985, the 70-year-old has made 18 animated features that fuse wild fantasy with more serious issues including environmentalism and feminism.

                  <br><i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> is the Miyazaki movie that put the filmmaker on the map. Released in 1988. The movie is so iconic that the character of Totoro—the giant rabbit/cat hybrid thing—is the Studio Ghibli symbol.</br>

                <strong>Howl's Moving Castle</strong>
                <br><i>Howl's Moving Castle</i> was an Oscar-nominated animated film for Hayao Miyazaki and one that was well-deserved of that honor. Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, this Miyazaki movie tells the story of a girl named Sophie who is turned old through a magical spell, falling in love with a handsome wizard.</br> 
                <br>What makes the movie so spectacular is the beautiful imagined animation. It's possibly the most gorgeous movie of Miyazaki's career. It also proves to be deep, as the main story plays out with a backdrop of war. </br>

                <strong>Castle In The Sky</strong>
                <br>Released in 1986, Castle in the Sky was the first Miyazaki movie produced by Ghibli Studio. The movie is also his first truly great film and is one of the most exciting and adventurous movies that the filmmaker ever created. The movie features two kids; a girl with the power to float in the air and a boy who wants to find the flying city of Laputa.</br> 
                <br>The two head off together on their adventure with evil government agencies and space pirates standing in their way. This might not be the most beautiful or artistic film he ever created, but this is Miyazaki thrilling audiences with one of the most entertaining stories of his long and successful career.</br>
